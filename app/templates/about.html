            <div class = "about_heading" id="About"><p>About This Project</p></div>
            We are a team of two developers who, after enjoying the Waffle, questioned whether every board was truly solvable in 10 moves (as the game claims). <br><br>
            We decided to implement the game and expand upon its features. This included adding in computer generated boards, optimal solutions, and move tracking, as some of the most important additions. <br><br>
            Notably, you can also import and optimally solve / play the daily Waffle. In finding optimal paths, we had to algorithmically solve the board - one of the key challenges of the project.

            <div class = "about_heading" id="Implementation"><p>Implementation</p></div>
            We begin each Waffle by selecting 6 words and assembling the solved puzzle. Then, we scamble our puzzle according to trends from the official game; i.e. greens in all corners and the center. 
            Furthermore, we ensure that each puzzle is minimally solvable in exactly 10 moves. After the puzzle is scrambled, we compare to the solved puzzle to determine the color of each square. <br><br>
            In addition to generating our own puzzles, we wanted to create a solver for any Waffle (including the daily Waffle). To do so, we created an algorithm which incorporates 
            many heuristics, each of which narrows down the potential solutions based purely on the initial coloring of the board. We make use of all available data in the starting board to find a unique solution (if one exists, more on this later).<br><br>
            By combining our solver and web scraping, we are able to import a fully playable copy of the daily Waffle. <br><br>
            Finally, we designed an algorithm to solve each board in the minimum number of moves. This algorithm works by prioritizing moves that "correct" two squares in one swap, followed by
            three squares in two swaps, and so forth. This algorithm is used to ensure that our randomly generated boards are minimally solvable in exactly 10 moves, and to output solutions when the user requests them.
            We can show optimal paths not only from the start, but from any point in the game (or output that the game is no longer solvable).<br><br>

            There are two cases in which we are unable to solve the daily Waffle. The first is if the Waffle contains a word that is not in our word list. The second is if there are multiple correct
            solutions to the board. In both cases we display as much of the correct board as we can solve. Unfortunately, the other functionality of our website is not available.
